      "i started smoking again and was heading right back to a road that would have lead to death and my 9 yr old son needed his father to be around\n",
      "but a friend who had quit smoking cigarettes which we all know have over 4 thousand chemicals in them tar and large amounts of nicotine are the cause of thousands of deaths yearly due to accidental fires and overall hamper the quality of life to smokers and also innocent non smokers due to second hand exposure\n",
      "well long story short i purchased a vape kit and promised my son i would never smoke again well for over a year now i am cigarettes free and have taken my nicotine level due to the freedom of choice from a 24 mg liquid to only 6mg and i was able to do it at my own pace and have had amazing results of success i don’t stink like smoke anymore i still have lung damage and hope to be vape and nicotine free soon but it will be by my own free will at my pace and without some government official or some selfish lobbyist working for tobacco companies who doesn’t care about how my son will feel if i kept smoking and died without a chance to fight back my smoking addiction or has no concern for my health just for how much money the tobacco company pays them to stand before congress and bash the very product that i feel has given me another chance at life……..\n",

      "i live in israel so i’m not sure whether the fda will have any effect on sale to our country but more thsn likely they will how can they try to regulate something which as it is saving millions of lives ok not to sell to minors is acceptable to provide child proof bottles to have written warnings that nicotine is a highly addictive substance and the ingredients should be present\n",
      "but to ban the flavoring and to limit the nicotine to something stupid like 4mg per bottle is absurd anyway i will continue vaping all of my life no-one is going to stop me and make me return to tobacco smoking ever\n",

      "when they started jacking the prices up to absurd levels my “solution” was to invest in a 440 # case of unprocessed “strip tobacco.” after about a week of smoking this unprocessed tobacco i bought a pack of the brand i’d been smoking about 2 cartons a week for going out to a dinner with some friends\n",

      "given that studies have already proven that vaping produces no harmful 2nd hand chemicals ( with “2nd hand smoke being one of their primary excuses for harassing smokers ) ; given vaping’s unparalleled results in getting people off of cigarettes ; given the dangers associated with garbage like chantix and wellbutrin ; and given the dangers associated with the obesity that so often follows quitting smoking any legitimate agency would do everything in their power to help this fledgling avenue for folks to get away from big tobacco’s crap\n",

      "in fact the smell of cigarette smoke is now semi – nauseous\n",

      "i have neurological disease which causes tremors and shaking and nicotine greatly reduces the shaking better than any of the numerous pharmaceutical products i’ve tried\n",
      "vaping is much less costly than using nrt products plus as with smoking when i’m shaking more i can vape more\n",
      "so that vaping helps with both not smoking and symptomatic treatment of the shaking is a great bonus for me\n",

      "it became a very expensive habit in my early 20’s i was already smoking almost up to 2 1/2 packs a week\n",
      "my smoking habit then escalated to the point of me having problems with my health relationship and family but just a year ago i stop hiding and telling lies to my wife and kids about me smoking which is hard to do when the odor is hard to hide and that’s thanks to a friend\n",
      "he introduced me to vaping and ever since then my relationship with my wife and kids has improved and i feel so much better stress free worry free i mean even my health and the activities i’m able to do\n",

      "so i may not have to much to say on how it’s changed my life but my wife and kids are my life so if things have changed for good and positive then vaping has changed my life\n",
      "and to who is reading this vaping is not a trend its a way of making a change and i think i “we the people” have the right to choose what makes us feel better\n",
      "now the vape community is no harm to nobody so help us out and do the right thing and save life’s from these big tobacco companies that are in it just for the money and don’t care about the people that have made them who they are\n",

      "as with most smokers none of these worked and had just about given up hope\n",
      "which was super depressing i have 2 kids and a beautiful wife so i kept looking\n",
      "and a guy at work showed up one day with a gas station ecig\n",
      "he claimed that it was working for him so i decided to give it a try\n",
      "i ordered one and on april 2 2013 it arrived\n",
      "i had told my wife who understanbly was skeptical about it working that once i started vaping i would not smoke i sure didn’t need another habit\n",
      "so i finished my last pack that day and started vaping and have not touched a cigarette since then\n",
      "i know some people have a tough time switching over but for me it was one of the easiest things i had done\n",
      "i was determined to not make my kids grow up without a father so i committed as much as humanly possible to vaping\n",
      "and since april 2 2013 i have not had a single cigarette\n",
      "of course i’ve long since moved up to bigger and better quality pvs\n",

      "before trying ecigs i tried other products on the market geared towards quitting smoking\n",
      "these products included welbutrin chantix nicorette gum and the patch\n",
      "none of the products above seemed to control my urge to quit\n",

      "it was looking at my almost one year old daughter in that room with a big smile on her face happy as a clam as i imagined her walking across a stage and being handed a diploma and looking out into the crowd with that same big smile on her face only to see her mom sitting alone next to an empty chair\n",
      "i then saw her with that same bright smile on her wedding day standing at the alter in a beautiful dress but i wouldn’t be there\n",
      "i wouldn’t be there for my daughter on the nights she needed a shoulder to cry on or the days when a proud smile could make all the difference in the world\n",

      "it was not without incentive that i failed and refused to try again\n",
      "it was because i felt so miserable and made everyone around me feel miserable that i reckoned that it wasn’t worth the “sickness” to put myself and others through that again\n",
      "then last december 2013 i was very ill\n",
      "i had trouble focusing terrible chills and trouble breathing\n",

      "i lay there thinking\n",

      "a chest x-ray.” after gathering what thoughts i could about what was going on it was as if a light switch went off in my head\n",

      "good thing\n",
      "the first three days were pretty much a snap\n",
      "unbelievably i had no withdrawal symptoms\n",
      "then the fourth day started\n",
      "it was 24 hours of the worst hell anyone can imagine\n",
      "i needed something along with the patches to help me\n",
      "i remembered seeing a video about e-cigarettes and how they worked\n",
      "i was hesitant to purchase one but i thought to myself if it helps me stay off smoking real cigarettes i need to try it\n",
      "i did\n",
      "once i realized i could refill the devices with liquid containing nicotine for me like my patches were did and slowly cut down on the nicotine strength of the liquid by purchasing liquids with varied amounts of nicotine and even some liquid with no nicotine at all i knew i would not ever smoke cigarettes with tobacco in them again\n",
      "it has now been four months and i am still not smoking cigarettes\n",
      "i vape\n",
      "by inhaling the vapor from these systems ( i have tried quite a few different kinds and sizes ) i know without a doubt i will make it\n",
      "i am a non-smoker and will stay that way\n",
      "i have cut my nicotine levels way way down through the help of the ability to mix tobacco flavored e liquid with varied amounts of nicotine\n",
      "some day i will reach zero nicotine and that will be the end of nicotine in my life\n",
      "i know in my heart this will happen\n",

      "i started out with a non-tobacco flavor and have never decided to switch back to that awful taste\n",
      "e-cigarettes do work\n",
      "i started smoking in 1975 at the tender age of not-quite-14\n",
      "throughout the last 39 years i tried 4 times to quit smoking with very little success : in 1984 a cold-turkey attempt lasted 3 months before i could not stand the suffering another minute and started smoking again ; in 1987 i became pregnant with my son and tried very hard to quit smoking but succeeded only in cutting down to 3 or 4 cigarettes a day\n",
      "in the following years i tried twice more using the patch and neither attempt lasted much more than a week before i could not stand it another minute and went back to smoking\n",
      "i can attest from personal experience that “the patch” simply does not work because simply replacing the nicotine is merely the smallest fraction of what is required to make a non-smoker out of a smoker\n",
      "by january of 2014 i had lost all hope of ever quitting cigarettes despite having watched my father die of lung cancer in 2006 and had no interest whatever in the suffering which i believed was required in order to quit smoking\n",
      "however we were in the middle of the coldest winter in 30 years and as an outdoors-only smoker i was sick of freezing to death just to satisfy my habit so i became interested in electronic cigarettes — e-cigarettes\n",
      "none of the drugstore disposables i tried — fin njoy and blu — were even slightly tolerable so i grew angry enough at the weather and my stupid habit and those extremely lame e-cigarettes and went to google to find more information about e-cigarettes ; what i discovered was a whole new world\n",
      "at the ecf the electronic cigarette forum i began learning about all the many kinds of hardware from the small cigarette-like true “e-cigarette” to the larger and much more powerful personal vaporizer “mod ” as well as all the different vendors of both those devices and the nicotine “juice” which is used in them\n",
      "starting around the 1st of february 2014 using one of the “cig-a-like” devices on a regular basis my smoking declined from about 15-20 per day to just 2 or 3 and by the end of february the actual cigarettes tasted so extremely bitterly foul to me that on february 27 i smoked my last and on february 28 2014 i enjoyed my first smoke-free 24 hours in 39 years savoring my e-cigarette and barely noticing the lack of cigarettes\n",
      "no one can tell me that e-cigarettes don’t work for quitting smoking because they absolutely do i don’t care what the american lung association the american cancer society or any other paid flunkies of big pharma have to say about it — those “charitable” organizations receive hundreds of thousands of dollars every year from big pharma so naturally big pharma’s agenda is their own despite those organizations’ noble-sounding names and publicly-stated agendas of wanting everyone to quit smoking — what they really want is for the pharmaceutical-supported gravy-train to continue so they will naturally say anything that big pharma pays them to say\n",
      "i publicly defy them to refute that\n",
      "stop taking big pharma’s money\n",
      "speak the truth\n",
      "e-cigarettes save lives by actually helping people quit smoking\n",

      "period\n",
      "i am one who has quit even without an initial objective of quitting\n",
      "e-cigarettes work and they do not cost a fortune unlike every single thing that big pharma has ever pushed on the public\n",
      "modern drug-lords do not wear “bling” and hang about on street-corners ; they wear suits and ties and hang around on wall street in country clubs and in exclusive restaurants between trips to the bank\n",
      "to quote don henley : “a man with a briefcase can steal more money than any man with a gun.” but big pharma is not just stealing money : they’re stealing lives with their evil mercenary stance that “e-cigarettes are dangerous and don’t work.” e-cigarettes are not dangerous they’re not nearly as expensive as everything from big pharma and they do work\n",

      "i have now gone to vaping for a little over 1 year now and feel so much better about myself\n",
      "i breath better smell better taste better no coughing in the morning from shortness of breath and i don’t stink is also a plus\n",

      "for almost 2 years i was living on tap water and ramen noodles and living in a cheap apartment in a rough part of town\n",
      "during this period i was unable to quit smoking\n",
      "the only vaping products i had access to were cig-a-likes which were not enough for me\n",
      "eventually i saved enough money for an ego-style setup which still was not enough to help me quit\n",
      "it wasn’t until i bought my first high-voltage mod that i achieved the vaping experience i needed and i’ve been 100 % smoke-free for almost 3 years\n",
      "keep in mind i wasn’t trying to quit\n",
      "i enjoyed smoking\n",
      "i knew it was bad for me and i didn’t care\n",
      "but because of the endless variety of flavors and devices vaping turned into more of a hobby for me\n",
      "it became the insatiable quest for more vapor\n",
      "after being depressed for nearly 2 years due to my college degree that didn’t mean anything to employers and my low pay and impoverished lifestyle a job became available at my local vape shop\n",
      "i was interviewed and hired on the spot and it was one of the happiest days of my life\n",
      "i was able to go into work and give my manager my 2 week’s notice\n",

      "my testimony\n",
      "50 years of smoking 2 packs a day… multiple “cut back” attempts with nicotine gum and patch were unsuccessful\n",
      "i never intended to totally quit smoking\n",
      "intended to continue smoking all my life but just cut back somewhat\n",
      "then i did research on “e-cigarettes” mainly through reading the e-cigarette forum online\n",
      "i skipped trying “cig-alikes” and went straight to using the bigger battery devices with cartomizers and tanks\n",
      "immediately i was able to actually stop smoking conventional cigarettes\n",
      "no cravings whatsoever for a regular cigarette\n",
      "i credit the flavors of the e-liquids the continuance of my hand-to-mouth habit and the appearance of the harmless vapor i exhaled with my success in stopping smoking entirely even though that was not my goal\n",
