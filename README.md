## Analysing language related to _vaping_ and _e-cigarettes_

E-cigarette usage (vaping) has grown in visibility and popularity in recent years. 
An e-cigarette can be seen as both a new category of device and activity but also 
an digital evolution of an established entity (the cigarette) and activity (smoking). 
This tension is likely to be seen in the language used as people discuss e-cigarettes. 
For instance, the device is a _cigarette_ with a common prefix _e-_ (e.g. _mail_ -> _e-mail_, 
_book_ -> _e-book_, _card_ -> _e-card_, _trade_ -> _e-trade_, _business_ -> _e-business_, _trade_ -> _e-trade_). 
Thus we expect the application of the same kind of language patterns used with a _cigarette_ to describe 
an _e-cigarette_ (e.g. _smoke_, _drag_, _inhale_ etc.).
